Of course she is stronger than me, her family taught her everything there is to know about magic, and I bet her family has some secret spells too...\". </p>\r\n                <p>Sandy unties you. \"I am sorry {props.name} I did get carried away.

People can't store magic, we don't have mana or anything like that... Well there are some people that can store magic, but they ain't really storing it in them, but in some part of them.

Well we use runes, items, ritualls and spells. To do magic you have to meet some conditions and you have to be skilled, else nothing will work or you might get bad side effects.\"</p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\"You have a sense of magic now. Magic items will have an aura on them. You should take every magic item you see, they might be useful later. But be careful, there are items that can think for themselves! And they could change you against your will.\" </p>\r\n                    \r\n                    <p>\"Next lesson.\" Sandy quickly changes the conversation \"About fighting or engaging in an activity, when you fight what matters is the other persons strenght. Right now you are completely average. You are around a {props.physical}, I am around {props.Sandy.physical} and Amy is around a {props.Amy.physical}, remember that items and being prepared can turn the tide of battles.</p>\r\n                    <p>\"Another important thing, in Maeville there are magical places, I just moved here, but I know there is a bar downtown where wizards like to go, there is also the Fur Forest, I heard really strong creatures live there. Be very careful when traveling, you are weak and if you are not prepared you will be broken.\"</p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\"That's it for now. To finish your training I need you to help me do a little task. I still want to grow larger breasts you know.\" Sandy touches her chest \"I think we can gather ingredients for a ritual that will get me another cup size. I'll need a transfer rune, which we can find one in the store. And I'll need some busty girl to take give me some boobage.\"</p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\"Find me in the store when you are ready\".
