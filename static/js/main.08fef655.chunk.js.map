And they could change you against your will.\" </p>\r\n                    \r\n                    <p>\"Next lesson.\" Sandy quickly changes the conversation \"About fighting or engaging in an activity, when you fight what matters is the other persons strenght.

And *zing* She takes your bag and rummages through it. \"It's this one!\" Copper takes out a small syringe filled with red liquid from the bag. It is indeed the supplement. \"I knew it! You did it! Copper jumps and kisses you.\" She then injects herself with the supplement.</p>\r\n            <p>\"Copper, wait\" You say \"The side effects might be cramping and pain around your body, use cream and take some pain medicine for that.\"</p>\r\n            <p>\"I will!\" Copper answers, she's excited. \"When will it start? How long does the effect takes?\" She asks. You mumble a bit, you don't really know. \"Whatever\" Copper jumps and interrupts you. \"I'm starving. I'll go eat.\" Copper hugs and kisses you in the cheek. \"Thank you\" She says.</p>\r\n            <p>\"I'll be around\" And she leaves.</p>\r\n    \r\n\r\n            <Link to={\"/GameMap\"} style={{ textDecoration: \"none\" }}>\r\n                <button type=\"button\" className=\"btn btn-primary\" onClick = {leaveBarnAfterGivingCopperTheDrug} >Game Map</button>\r\n            </Link>  \r\n\r\n            </Col3>\r\n            </>\r\n  \r\n      )\r\n    } else if(props.flags.includes(\"CopperWillExperienceFirstEffects\") && Math.random() < .35){\r\n        let seduceCopper = () =>{\r\n            setOpenDialog(true);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        return(\r\n            <>\r\n            <Col1>\r\n                <SetCol1\r\n                />\r\n            </Col1>\r\n            <Col2 BackImage = {FarmBarn}>\r\n                <img alt ={\"Not found\"} src={props.CopperImage} style ={{width : props.characterImageWidth, height: props.characterImageHeight}}></img>\r\n                <SimpleDialog\r\n                    openDialog={openDialog}\r\n                    handleDialogClose = {()=>{\r\n                            setOpenDialog(false);\r\n                            props.onAddMinutes(10);\r\n                            props.onSpliceFlag(\"CopperWillExperienceFirstEffects\");\r\n                            props.onSetCharacterStats(\"Copper\",\"cowTf\",props.charactersStats.Copper.cowTf + 1);\r\n                            props.onAddItem(\"heavyCream\",1);\r\n                            props.onPushFlag(\"GotCreamFromCopper\");\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                >\r\n                    <p style={{color:\"black\"}}></p>\r\n                    <img alt ={\"Not found\"} src={Copper_tf2_ShowsBreasts} style ={{width : props.characterImageWidth, height: props.characterImageHeight}}></img>\r\n                    \r\n                    <p>Copper leans in and kisses you.
