Of course she is stronger than me, her family taught her everything there is to know about magic, and I bet her family has some secret spells too...\". </p>\r\n                <p>Sandy unties you. \"I am sorry {props.name} I did get carried away. But you did steal my bracelet after all.\" Sandy pauses for a moment. \"umm... {props.name}... How did it feel? How does it fill when your breasts fill with milk?, how does it feel when the milk comes out?... You know, I worked so hard to get that bracelet. I really wanted to have it.\" - Sandys voice breaks for a second. \"Fucking asshole\".</p>\r\n                <p>At this point you are completely untied. You are exhausted. Sandy calms down and says:\r\n                \"{props.name}, you should know that this city is special. The magic around here is strengthening, and it's nothing like we have ever seen before. A lot of pople will move here. Good people, bad people, everything in between. We'll have to be really careful. For now, you should just go to sleep. And remember, this building is a stronghold of magic, Amys family have casted some amazing protective magic around here, so as long as you are inside the building you should be fine.\"</p>\r\n\r\n                <Link to={\"/Home\"} style={{ textDecoration: \"none\" }}>\r\n                    <button type=\"button\" className=\"btn btn-primary\" onClick={LACBRAQSandyApartmentFinishNowToYourApmtAndSandyTeaches}>Leave</button>\r\n                </Link>\r\n                \r\n            </Col3>\r\n            </>\r\n            );\r\n    } else if(props.flags.includes(\"SandyTeachesMagicQuestInHerApartmentPart_1\")){\r\n        let SANTMQSandyWillBeInStore = () =>{\r\n            props.onAddMinutes(10);\r\n            props.onPushFlag(\"SANTMQSandyWillBeInStore\");\r\n            props.onSpliceFlag(\"SandyTeachesMagicQuestInHerApartmentPart_1\");\r\n            props.onPushFlag(\"STORE_DISCOVERED\");\r\n          }\r\n      \r\n      \r\n          return(\r\n              <>\r\n              <Col1>\r\n                  <SetCol1\r\n                  />\r\n              </Col1>\r\n              <Col2 BackImage = {SandyLivingRoom}>\r\n                    <img alt = {\"Not found\"} src = {props.SandyImage} style ={{width : props.characterImageWidth, height: props.characterImageHeight}}></img>\r\n              </Col2>  \r\n      \r\n              <Col3 > \r\n                    <p>\"Hello {props.name}!

My ma' allways said I was a great teacher, I could talk and explain things all day! Are you ready to learn? Of course you are!, let's start with the first lesson:\"</p>\r\n                    <p>\"Magic comes from nature, space, everything around us, magic does not come from humans, we people just try to use it so it does what we want. People can't store magic, we don't have mana or anything like that... Well there are some people that can store magic, but they ain't really storing it in them, but in some part of them. I kno of a woman who stores energy in her boobs and when she's preparing to fight her boobs get giantic!\" Sandy sighs and looks at her own bust.</p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\"So how do we use magic? Well we use runes, items, ritualls and spells. To do magic you have to meet some conditions and you have to be skilled, else nothing will work or you might get bad side effects.\"</p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\"You have a sense of magic now. Magic items will have an aura on them. You should take every magic item you see, they might be useful later. But be careful, there are items that can think for themselves! And they could change you against your will.\" </p>\r\n                    \r\n                    <p>\"Next lesson.\" Sandy quickly changes the conversation \"About fighting or engaging in an activity, when you fight what matters is the other persons strenght. Right now you are completely average. You are around a {props.physical}, I am around {props.Sandy.physical} and Amy is around a {props.Amy.physical}, remember that items and being prepared can turn the tide of battles.</p>\r\n                    <p>\"Another important thing, in Maeville there are magical places, I just moved here, but I know there is a bar downtown where wizards like to go, there is also the Fur Forest, I heard really strong creatures live there. Be very careful when traveling, you are weak and if you are not prepared you will be broken.\"</p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\"That's it for now. To finish your training I need you to help me do a little task. I still want to grow larger breasts you know.\" Sandy touches her chest \"I think we can gather ingredients for a ritual that will get me another cup size. I'll need a transfer rune, which we can find one in the store. And I'll need some busty girl to take give me some boobage.\"</p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\"Find me in the store when you are ready\".

Amy is tired but does not care, she does not want rest. Amy craved the ache, Amy wants you inside her. All. The. Time. You put your weight on top of her, she squeezes you in further and further. You see Amy's face, and your sweat dropping on her body. AMY then mounts you, she holds you in and gets you inside her.</p>\r\n                <p>You two go mad. Your cock splitting her in two. Amy holds you down, her breasts to your face, your hands exploring her body.</p>\r\n                <p>You heave and pant, there is no end to the pleasure. And you two copy each others movements, lick, kiss, fuck each other. It all culminates in Amy cumming and collapsing over your stomach.</p>\r\n                \r\n            \r\n\r\n                <Link to={\"/GameMap\"} style={{ textDecoration: \"none\" }}>\r\n                    <button type=\"button\" className=\"btn btn-primary\" onClick = {GoBack}>Back</button>\r\n                </Link>  \r\n                    \r\n            </Col3>\r\n            </>\r\n  \r\n      )\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    else if (props.flags.includes(\"FLIRTED_AMY_BAD\") || props.flags.includes(\"SEDUCED_AMY_BAD\") || props.flags.includes(\"KISS_AMY_BAD\") || props.flags.includes(\"FUCK_AMY_BAD\") || props.flags.includes(\"CONVINCE_TAKE_DRUG_FAIL\") || props.flags.includes(\"STEALTH_TAKE_DRUG_FAIL\") ){\r\n\r\n\r\n        return(\r\n            <>\r\n            <Col2 BackImage = {props.backImageChar}>\r\n            <img alt = {\"Not found\"} src = {props.ImageChar} style ={{width : props.characterImageWidth, height: props.characterImageHeight}}></img>\r\n            </Col2>  \r\n    \r\n            <Col3 > \r\n\r\n                <p>Amy looks at you quizzically. \"I have to go\" and leaves.</p>\r\n                \r\n                <Link to={\"/GameMap\"} style={{ textDecoration: \"none\" }}>\r\n                    <button type=\"button\" className=\"btn btn-primary\" onClick = {GoToGameMap}>Game map</button>\r\n                </Link>  \r\n\r\n                \r\n                    \r\n            </Col3>\r\n            </>\r\n  \r\n      )\r\n    } else if(props.flags.includes(\"GIVE_ITEMS_AMY\")){\r\n\r\n        let GoBackFromItems = () =>{\r\n            props.onAddMinutes(10);\r\n            props.onSpliceFlag(\"GIVE_ITEMS_AMY\");\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        let itemsKeys = Object.keys(props.items);\r\n\r\n        return(\r\n            <>\r\n            <Col2>\r\n                {\r\n                AMYItemsLike.map((AMYItem)=>{\r\n                    return(\r\n                    <>\r\n                        <Link to={props.CurrentLocation} style={{ textDecoration: \"none\" }}>\r\n                            <button type=\"button\" className=\"btn btn-primary\" onClick = {AMYItemsLike.action} disabled = {itemsKeys[AMYItem] > 0?
